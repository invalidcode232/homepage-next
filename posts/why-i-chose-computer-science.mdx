My interest in computing mainly stems from my interest in tinkering with software.
I remember the first time my dad brought me an old computer, it was incredibly exciting for me to try out all of the computer's various capabilities. 
One thing that made a lasting impression on me was PowerPoint. It was the tool all my teachers used
to create teaching us. I was very happy, for it gave me a blank canvas, where I have access to all the 
tools, albeit virtually, to design whatever I wanted to. This is what makes computing very interesting for me. In real life, I have to buy all the 
appliances needed to accomplish what I want, which often involves a lot of money and effort to get. 
For example, painting requires various different types of paintbrushes, inks, and canvas. With computers, I could access all the tools needed with just a click of a button.
This convenience of doing virtually everything I wanted is what motivated me to play around with computers all day.  
  
However, as time passed by, I realized that even though the existing computer software covers most of my use cases. It often lacks some niche features that I wanted. 
That was when I started thinking about making my own software for my own needs. For example, I wanted a flashcard app that displays flashcards based spaced repetition. 
But when I looked it up online, most didn't have it the way I wanted, or was locked behind a paywall. I was determined to create my own application, 
it was a daunting task, however, in the process, I learnt many things. I cried a lot, yet the feeling of the thing you've spent lots of hours for finally working, 
brought me tears of joy. And not only did the application work, I even shared it to my friends and helped them study. This motivated me a lot, and soon I was doing project after project,
creating all sorts of things I can think of. 

I think computers and software have become an essential part of our daily lives. It has revolutionized the way we think, the way we behave, and the way we communicate.
For instance, The rise of phones and communication softwares allowed us to talk with anyone. Online news sites, books, and encyclopedias allow us to access the latest information
and knowledge from around the world with just the tip of our fingers. Online banking and payment has become an integral part of our economy. 
In the future, I hope to contribute to the society and create useful things that can change people's lives.
