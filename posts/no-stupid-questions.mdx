We often hear the phrase "There is no such thing as a stupid question", but how true is it? 
One of the first known records of the phrase was in a 1970 Dear Abby column, which said that there was no such thing as a stupid question as long as it's sincere.
If we use this definition, then in order to further analyze the statement, we need to define what a "sincere" question is, for there are many different motives behind every question.
Some people ask questions to seek answers in order to satisfy their curiosity, some may ask questions to seek validation from other people, or to offend someone via means of sarcasm.
This motive is important to address as questions that are not sincere, such as ones that are purely sarcastic or rhetorical, hold no meaning; they do not benefit the questioner nor the one who responded it.

So, what is a sincere question? In my opinion, a sincere question is a question that originates from a genuine attempt to learn something. 
With that said, I agree with the phrase as by asking a genuine question, we are acknowledging our lack of knowledge about a particular topic. 
This means that the questioner is able to differentiate what they do know, and what they do not, and it is only when someone has come to terms with their own lack of knowledge, can they then proceed to learn from it. 
In contrast, people who does not acknowledge their own illiteracy will forever live in ignorance, lies, untruths, thereby being "stupid".
For example, I once had a question in elementary school, I asked about the composition of the yellowish red flame of fire. 
My classmates laughed and teased me for asking such a stupid and unneccessary question. At that moment, I felt very stupid and embarrassed as I thought it was common knowledge that 
everyone just knew. 
However, little did I know it was the first time both me and all my other classmates learnt about states of matter. 
I gained information I previously did not know, and it sparked my curiosity to learn more about the matter.
Hence, a question would not be stupid as long as someone is gaining meaningful knowledge from it.

Some people might assume that questions might be stupid because they are seemingly easy. 
However, this statement is fallacious as what is easy and what is not is subjective, and is affected by numerous factors, such as age, culture, and the people they were exposed to.
To illustrate, for many of us asking about the origin of rain might seem obvious or useless, however in the eyes of a child, this question makes perfect sense; they have an innate trait to be curious and understand the world as much as they can. 
This curiosity is often lost once people have reached adulthood, making questions like those feel useless and a "waste of time".
However, I think this lost of curiosity is such a shame. Imagine a world, where people are asking all the simple yet necessary questions. Think questions such as "why are we here", "why do we exist?", "why do people go from one place to another".  
While these may seem purely philosophical and meaningless, it is only once we answered these basic questions can we truly understand ourselves.
